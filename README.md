The Game
The Pang imitation
	Our game is a remake of the modern classic – Pang. 
The Story
In our game a lonely ninja is left alone in the battlefield of life, surrounded by thousands of pesky bubbles. Our ninja doesn’t really like taking baths, so he’s afraid of the bubbles. It’s up to the player to help the ninja and not get him washed up. Do you have what it takes to be a real ninja? Come and show us! Join today.
The Technologies
	The game is developed using animation based on Canvas and SVG, as well as jQuery library for the menus. Each and every team member contributed to the game and everyone had a fair share in creating the application.
The Difficulties
	Pressured by the short amount of time and overwhelming amount of homeworks to be submitted, not to mention the inevitable JavaScript UI & DOM exam, the team faced many challenges, mostly of unnatural aesthetics. Fortunately for us, with pure commitment and self-sacrifices from a few good men (and a woman) – the game was created on time. 
	Main issues during the development phase – difficulties with constant pushing and pulling in GitHub, while a few people work on the same file, difficulties with finding a proper time to communicate. Close to no problems concerning delivering the code itself and the logic behind its implementation.
